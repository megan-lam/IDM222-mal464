<div class= "case_content">
     <p class="case">This is a project I completed for User Interface Design II. The objective was to redesign an 
         existing news/article based website. We had to redesign high-fidelity prototypes for home and article 
         pages for desktop, mobile, and tablet devices. The protoypes had to include at least 15 different 
         microinteractions, 5 per device. These were created using both Sketch and Flinto.</p>
             <p class="case">My first step in this process was research and data analyzation. Slate had released an article 
                 that detailed their user demographics and from this I was able to see the website’s main readership. 
                69% of Slate’s audience is between the ages of 25 - 54. This meant that my redesign had to cater to a
                wide age range, while still maintaining the site’s unique values.</p> </div>

        <img srcset="/images/sh900.jpg 900w,
        /images/ss600.jpg 600w,
        /images/ss300.jpg 300w"
    sizes="(min-width:300px) 30vw, 25vw"
    src="/images/ss300.jpg"
    alt="Slate sketches" />

                    <div class="case_content"><p class="case">Slate writes articles for a variety of genres, ranging from politics to a gossip column, Dear 
                     Prudence. This gossip column is also Slate’s most popular attraction. Knowing this, I wanted to 
                     prioritize this section in my design to hopefully attract more readers to it and allow for easier
                      navigation. Though Slate delivers a mix of news and pop culture, it does so in a way that maintains 
                     a youthful aspect. Slate’s approach to news is fun and upbeat, similar to Vice. It allows it’s users 
                     to be educated and informed without feeling like they are reading news, which is the site’s unique 
                     selling point.</p>

                        <p class="case">One of the main issues with this site was the navigation. With the large amount of articles
                         scattered across the homepage, the website felt cluttered and overwhelming, especially to
                         a user who has never visited the site before. My goal was to simplify the interface to create 
                         one that is easier to navigate, while still keeping the youthful vibes of the site. I wanted to 
                         add more creative elements to reflect this and began sketching wireframes for all three devices, 
                         home and article page included.</p></div>
                         <div class="w">

                     <img srcset="/images/sw900.jpg 800w,
                     /images/sw600.jpg 600w,
                     /images/sw300.jpg 340w"
                 sizes="(min-width:300px) 38vw, 38vw"
                 src="/images/sw300.jpg"
                 alt="Slate wireframes" />

                    </div>
        <div class="case_content"><p class="case">Once I decided which elements I wanted to keep from my sketches, I mocked them up in Sketch. I also needed to
             consider ad placement in these wireframes since it is one of the main revenue sources for the site.</p>
             <p class="case">When choosing colors for the website, I looked at numerous options. One of these included a gray/blue theme
                  to play off of slate gray tones. The middle option of the three shown is Slate’s current color theme and
                   the one I ulimately decided on. I felt that their hot pink and dark purple tones added to the identity
                    of the site. Dear Prudence’s signature color is also hot pink, so I felt that taking these colors away 
                    would not match the brand that Slate had already established.</p></div>
            <div class="sc">

            <img srcset="/images/sc600.jpg 600w,
            /images/sc300.jpg 300w"
        sizes="(min-width:300px) 38vw, 38vw"
        src="/images/sc300.jpg"
        alt="Slate colors" />

            </div>
        <div class="case_content"><p class="case">Typography and font choice played a significant factor in this project. Since Slate is an article
            based site, I needed to ensure that the fonts I used were readable and could be differentiated easily. For my 
            heading font, I went with Timeless Bold and chose Proxima Nova for my copy. I felt that these fonts had a good 
            amount of contrast that made them distinguishable and weren’t overly structured,fitting the overall aesthetic of 
            my redesign the best.</p>
        <p class="case">I also performed heuristic testing on the original website to a group of ten people and reworked my designs based 
            off of their feedback. The users were asked to rate the usability of the site and add any additional comments on the design.</p></div>
