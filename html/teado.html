<h1 class="teado_heading">Tea-do Redesign</h1>
<div class="case_content">
<p>This project was completed with a group of students in my Human Computer Interaction class. 
    Throughout the class, we learned about discoverability and the importance of human-centered design. 
    A large part of this had to do with Norman’s principles of design. Our task was to redesign a website 
    of our choice, incorporating the usability techniques we learned.</p> </div>

    <div class= "case_content"><p>The website we chose to redesign was Tea-Do. All of the pages on the original website contained 
        outdated content, and repetitive menu features. Many links on the website also lead to error messages, 
        rendering the site largely unusable.</p> 
        <p>
            For this project, we were able to submit this website on UserTesting.com and receive feedback on what was working and what wasn’t.
            Many of our testers agreed on the fact that the website needed improvements on usability. We tasked them with trying to find certain
            menu items, and all three testers expressed that there wasn’t enough clarity within the menu, especially for people that have never had bubble tea before.</p></div>
    <img src="/images/portfolio_pics/teado_pics/menu.png" alt="Menu" class="teado_pics">
    <div class="case_content"><p>Another pain point of this website was the homepage. Though the image displays the storefront, that’s all it does. They would’ve
        liked to see something that was more useful instead of just an image.</p>
        <p>We started our redesign by working on sketches and
            wireframes. Our interface was created and prototyped in Adobe XD. We wanted to modernize the website while staying true to the store’s aesthetic and improve the overall usability and flow.</p></div>
    <img src="/images/portfolio_pics/teado_pics/pic3.png" alt="Teado" class="teado_pics">
    <div class="case_content"><p>Our redesign took a text based website and added images to liven it up. This gave users an idea of what each item is and the descriptions clarify what it is made of. We added an order system to give the website more purpose. Another addition was
        the customer reviews on the homepage. These help give users more information instead of a static image. The hero image on the homepage was switched to a carousel of pictures to add even more interest.
        We simplified the menu options so that they were less confusing to users and listed other Philadelphia locations along with their hours of operation. All of these changes contributed to the usability of the site and we were able to build this off of feedback from testers</p>
